# FacebookHackathon_March2015
This is the project build in in a team with Dainis G. at the Facebook Hackathon, London 2015.

Initially it was meant to be something completely different, it turned out to be something that let's you post on someone's wall and that someone should hear your message [message being spoken, with voice].

For accessing user's profile we used the facebook's "graph.api".
For the text-to-voice part we used javascript.
